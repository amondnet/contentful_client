## Steps for read and write access (recommended)

Step 1: Install the [Contentful CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentful-cli)

Step 2: Login to Contentful through the CLI. It will help you to create a [free account](https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/) if you don't have one already.
```
contentful login
```
Step 3: Create a new space
```
contentful space create --name 'My space for the example app'
```
Step 4: Seed the new space with the content model. Replace the `SPACE_ID` with the id returned from the create command executed in step 3
```
contentful space seed -s '<SPACE_ID>' -t the-example-app
```
Step 5: Head to the Contentful web app's API section and grab `SPACE_ID`, `DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Step 6: Open `variables.xcconfig` and inject your credentials so it looks like this

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE_ID>
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN>
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=<PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

Step 7: Open `the-example-app.swift.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the app on a simulator or device. Navigate to settings and enable editorial features and then take a look around the app.

Enabling editorial features will reveal which pieces of content are drafts or pending changes in your Contentful space.
